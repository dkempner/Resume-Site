                            I'm a software developer with over 5 years of experience building technology and businesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've benefited from accelerated personal growth thanks to startup experience. Justifying every decision in a resource constrained environment has allowed me to grow into an efficient and conscientious worker. My experience with sales, fundraising, and customer support extend my growth as a personable and empathetic business leader.

                        <h2>Lead Software Developer @ <a target="_blank" href="https://mren.com">MREN</a></h2>
                        <p class="subDetails">Feb 2014 - Present</p>
                        <p>We started MREN with the goal to connect the Commercial Real Estate industry around what professionals care about most, deals.</p>
                        <p>We made a slick and modern web application with file sharing, chat, and networking tools. It became obvious that the market MREN could address was bigger than real estate and could serve people in all collaborative industries.</p>
                        <p>I began as a principal software engineer, building our applications from the ground up with a small team. As our product began to grow, I began to take on more diverse roles. I became the sole salesperson, client contact, a support agent, a fundraiser, and marketer while continuing to build the platform.</p>
                        <p>As a developer, I independently made platform features: from user pain to design and implementation until release and long term support. I built WebSocket driven communication layers for chat, mobile notifications, and real-time file sharing. I created our continuous integration pipeline and user monitoring systems, and scaled our application servers from singular to globally available. I mostly worked in ASP.NET with Node.js microservices where necessary. Because our applications are so interaction-heavy, a majority of my time was spent on the frontend, in our JavaScript SPA framework.</p>

                        <p class="subDetails">Jul 2012 - Feb 2014</p>
                        <p>My first job in software. I came in self-taught with no expectations and left as someone with the confidence to create.</p>
                        <p>I worked my way from entry level to a trusted mid-level team member by claiming responsibility and driving projects independently. I dipped my toes into engineering leadership when I built a summer intern program and recruited 4 CS students to help make the firm's first native mobile app.</p>
                        <p>Along with a junior partner, we built the firm's web-based onboarding platform in ASP.NET and Knockout.js. I created an internal financial calculation library that was used by other teams to ensure data-integrity. I also redesigned the company's public marketing site as the sole technologist in a 10 person marketing committee.</p>
