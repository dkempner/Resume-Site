	                        <p>We started MREN with the goal to connect the Commercial Real Estate industry around what professionals care about most, deals.</p>
	                        <p>We made a slick and modern web application with file sharing, chat, and networking tools. It soon became obvious that the pains MREN solved were bigger than real estate and could serve people in any collaborative industry.</p>
	                        <p>I began my tenure as a principal software engineer, building applications from the ground up with a small team. Resources are tight in a startup and I began to take on more diverse roles. I became the sole salesperson, client contact, support agent, fundraiser, marketer, and countless other jobs while continuing to build the platform.</p>
	                        <p>With this experience I've learned confidence in myself through discipline. No longer do I consider engineering a pigeonhole for the smart but anti-social. A well socialized and engaging engineer is one of the greatest assets to a company and organization. Business creates constraints and understands values, while engineering creates products. My hard work and pursuit of improvement has placed me at the intersection of these values.</p>

	                        <p>My first job in software. I came in self-taught with no expectations and left as someone with the confidence to create instead of improve. I worked my way from entry level to a trusted mid-level team member. I showed signs of engineering leadership when I built a summer intern program and recruited 4 CS students to help make the firm's first mobile app.</p>
